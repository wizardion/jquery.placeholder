jquery.placeholder

<div id="main_content_wrap" class="outer">
		
	<h2>Hi All!</h2>
	
	<div>
		I hasten to present your new completely painless plugin Placeholder.<br/><br/>
		This plug-in is quite different from the existing logical approach of other plugins.
		It was reviewed and was selected in accordance with a popular browsers.<br/><br/>
		Full support for this plugin has the following browsers:<br/>
		<ul type="decimal">
			<li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Explorer:</b> 6, 7, 8, 9.</li>
			<li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Internet Explorer 10:</b> native.</li>
			<li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Chrome:</b> native.</li>
			<li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox:</b> native.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		
		<h2>It very fast:</h2>
	
		<div>
			Ð¡ode is fully optimized for browsers, and works very well.<br/>
			You will not notice the difference between Chome(where this plugin is disabled and uses the native function of the browser) and IE*
			<br/>
			<br/>
			It operates as follows. The plugin itself determines whether a browser supports attribute "placeholder" and if not, then it include this support. If the browser has support for this attribute, then this plugin is disabled.<br/>
			So you can don't  worry, about the extra resources, it does not take.<br/>
		</div>
		
		
		<h2>It very easy:</h2>
		
		
	Just include this plugin on your page and run it when you want.<br/>
	For example: <br/>
	
	
	<ul type="decimal">
		<li>
			<b style="font-weight: bold;">Include: </b><br/>
			<div class="inner content">
				<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/jquery.alex-placeholder-0.3.6.js" />
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b style="font-weight: bold;">Run: </b><br/>
			<div class="inner content">
				$(window).load(function(){<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;$('.loginControl').placeholder();<br/>
				});<br/>
			</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	Good luck with your development!
